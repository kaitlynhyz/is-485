## Project Description
The objective of this project is to apply the content convered in the course to produce a powerful visual data driven narrative to provoke and prompt an action. The key to selecting a topic is to find a dataset related to a topic that the group is interested in. 

## Big Idea
> As a graduating high school senior, I want to gain information about potential career paths so that I am confident with the major I pursue in college.

We want to tell a story about how recent college graduates find a job. Whether that job is low paying or high paying. Did their degree help them secure a job requiring a degree, not a degree, and/or a low way job? We also want to look at the ratio of men to women finding jobs in the field they majored in.

Our dataset provides information about college students, specifically recent graduates (ages <28), graduate students (ages 25+), and an inclusive demographic of all ages. These surveys were conducted between 2012 and 2012 as part of a census. The dataset is available from the [American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Series.](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html)

We plan to analyze how college and the majors have prepared individuals for the workforce by visualizing the data from surveyd graduates. These surveys allow us to perform in-depth analysis on factors such as:
- Gender-ratios
- Salaries
- Employment types
- Unemployment rates
- Popularity and saturation of that major's career path
